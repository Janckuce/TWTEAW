 balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "Although constantly arguing over some new crises since the Vienna Conference a major European war has been avoided on the European continent for almost a hundred years. But increasingly so in the past few decades tensions have been increasingly rising in the Balkans with various empires seeking to secure their dominance in the region. It will only takes one small spark to blow the Balkan Powder keg."

 TUR_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "The 1910s were a critical decade for the Ottoman Empire, marking the final stage of a long decline. The empire was already struggling with internal divisions, nationalist movements. The 1908 Young Turk Revolution had restored constitutional rule, but the new leadership—especially pushed for centralization and Turkish nationalism, which deepened ethnic tensions. The empire’s defeat in the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) cost it nearly all of its European lands, dealing a blow to its prestige and stability. The Young Turks, now firmly in power, increasingly turned to authoritarianism and sought alliances abroad to protect the crumbling state."

 GER_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "In 1911, Germany was a powerful and ambitious empire under Kaiser Wilhelm II. It was a unified nation-state (since 1871) led by the Kingdom of Prussia, and had become a major industrial, military, and scientific power in Europe. Politically, it was an authoritarian monarchy with limited parliamentary influence. Germany was in a period of intense militarization and naval expansion, led by Admiral von Tirpitz, which increased tensions with Britain. Internationally, it was involved in imperial competition, especially in Africa. In 1911, Germany challenged French control in Morocco during the Agadir Crisis, nearly sparking a war with France and Britain"

 AUS_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "Austria-Hungary is one of the great powers of Europe in 1911, ruled by Emperor Franz Joseph I. It’s a dual monarchy—Austria and Hungary are technically two separate states, but they share the same emperor and foreign policy. The empire stretches across much of Central and Eastern Europe, home to over 50 million people from many different ethnic groups—Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Croats, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, and more. Nationalist tensions are rising. The 1908 annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina  has increased friction with Serbia and its ally, Russia. There’s a sense that conflict is brewing in the Balkans."

 YEM_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "The Emirate of Jabal Shammar was founded in the early 19th century and grew into a powerful rival of the Saudis in central Arabia. Ruled by the Rashidi dynasty, it is an autocratic, tribal monarchy with strong political and military ties to the Ottoman Empire. The Rashidis had been historical adversaries of the House of Saud, whom they had driven out of Riyadh in the late 1800s with Ottoman support. the Rashidi emirate had firmly entrenched itself as the Ottoman Empire's key ally in central Arabia, acting as both a buffer and a proxy against growing British influence and the ambitions of the Saudis and Hashemites."

 BUL_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "The 1910s were a dramatic and difficult decade for Bulgaria. In 1912, Bulgaria joined the Balkan League with Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro to fight the Ottoman Empire in the First Balkan War, gaining territory. However, disagreements over the spoils led to the Second Balkan War in 1913, where Bulgaria fought its former allies and suffered defeat, losing much of its gains. In 1915, Bulgaria entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers, hoping to recover lost lands. Although it had early victories, the war ended in failure. By 1918, Bulgaria was defeated and forced to sign the Treaty of Neuilly in 1919."
 SER_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "In 1911, the Kingdom of Serbia, under King Peter I, was growing in strength and nationalism, aiming to unite South Slavs and resist Austro-Hungarian influence. Anger over Austria-Hungary’s 1908 annexation of Bosnia fueled anti-Austrian sentiment and closer ties with Russia. Serbia modernized its army and saw the rise of the Black Hand, a secret nationalist group formed by army officers that pushed for a Greater Serbia. Though 1911 was peaceful, the country was preparing for conflict, soon to play a key role in the Balkan Wars and World War I."

 POR_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "On October 5, 1910, the Portuguese monarchy was overthrown, ending the reign of King Manuel II and establishing the First Portuguese Republic. This revolution was driven by dissatisfaction with royal rule, economic struggles, and influence from republican and liberal ideas sweeping Europe. The new regime abolished the monarchy, church privileges, and symbols of the old order, seeking to modernize Portuguese society through secular reforms and increased civil liberties. Despite its revolutionary ideals, the First Republic quickly became politically unstable." 
 SAF_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "The 1910s marked a pivotal decade in South African history, characterized by political consolidation, racial segregation, and the early stirrings of resistance that would shape the country’s future. At the heart of these changes was the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, which unified four British colonies—Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony—into a single dominion within the British Empire. This new political entity laid the foundation for a centralized, white-dominated government that would formalize racial discrimination for decades to come."
 AST_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "Australia was still in its national infancy. The country had only recently federated — in 1901 — meaning the six British colonies had united to form the Commonwealth of Australia just a decade earlier. So by 1911, Australians were beginning to figure out what it meant to be a nation, not just a collection of British outposts."
 BEL_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "In 1911, Belgium was a small but influential European nation under King Albert I, who had taken the throne in 1909. The country was highly industrialized, especially in coal, steel, and textiles, and was considered one of the most developed economies on the continent. The demand for universal male suffrage was growing, as the existing voting system heavily favored the wealthy. Social tensions were also rising between the Dutch-speaking Flemish population and the French-speaking Walloons. Internationally, Belgium had recently taken formal control of the Congo Free State and was facing scrutiny over colonial abuses."
