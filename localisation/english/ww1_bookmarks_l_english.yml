 BUL_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "The 1910s were a dramatic and difficult decade for Bulgaria. In 1912, Bulgaria joined the Balkan League with Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro to fight the Ottoman Empire in the First Balkan War, gaining territory. However, disagreements over the spoils led to the Second Balkan War in 1913, where Bulgaria fought its former allies and suffered defeat, losing much of its gains. In 1915, Bulgaria entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers, hoping to recover lost lands. Although it had early victories, the war ended in failure. By 1918, Bulgaria was defeated and forced to sign the Treaty of Neuilly in 1919."
 SER_balkan_powder_keg_desc:0 "In 1911, the Kingdom of Serbia, under King Peter I, was growing in strength and nationalism, aiming to unite South Slavs and resist Austro-Hungarian influence. Anger over Austria-Hungary’s 1908 annexation of Bosnia fueled anti-Austrian sentiment and closer ties with Russia. Serbia modernized its army and saw the rise of the Black Hand, a secret nationalist group formed by army officers that pushed for a Greater Serbia. Though 1911 was peaceful, the country was preparing for conflict, soon to play a key role in the Balkan Wars and World War I."
