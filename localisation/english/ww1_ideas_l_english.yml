With now each region and kingdom having some of it's own governing power they used it not in so well meant manner, the Czech parliament keeps trying to slow down reforms or even block them as a whole, while for example Croatians are much happier to be more and more dependent on our leadership than the on Hungarian one. The same way as are Poles and Ruthenians thanks to which we for now know that Galicia should be safe but still not as safe as we thought, all of this needs to be dealt with as soon as possible until the Hungarians or other mayor powers decide we are too weak to resist, get few ideas to the Kaiser himself, we need to act.

A huge difference between our view of multiculturalism and ethnicity can be seen the first moment one arrives to Felvídek or Erdély where Romanian or Slovak peasents are subjagated to very systematical 'Magyarization' thanks to which many culturual traditions of other groups of people start to slowly fade out, especially in regions of Felvídek where the process of Hungarinisation been going according to their plan, that couldn't be said about the same program in Erdély where many Romanians still live and resist magyarization as much as they can. Of course many of these groups that resist are not then allowed to be as educated as their hungerian counterparts and so the graphs show that Erdély Romanians living in high mountains are the most iliterate, many people had already whispered in to our Kaisers ear about the situtation beyond the Danube but for the sake of not damaging our relations with the leadership of Hungary, our Kaiser decided to not intervene, even if he would like to.

Average working man would not stop not only for a second to take some time off as their boss could be somewhere and could have seen them, or maybe Evidenzbureau agents are maybe roaming around and then them could report them to their boss. One those man was also Josef or Pepa, how he was called in his Czech hometown and family. It was today that Pepa who had been a student for a long period of his life finally had a chance to get his so much wanted license for woodcrafting and open his own little shop in Židenice. Thanks to so many new regulations beeing loosen he can finally speak with the clerk in his mothertoung, in Czech. When he comes to the clerks window he sees a old looking man with a grown moustache and starts to talk to him in Czech, the clerk looks with a weird smirk on his face and then yells something in German on his other cooworkers and leaves. In a second another a bit younger clerk arrives and askes Pepa what he needs here, and so Pepa only smiles at him and slowly spells out his name, a bit later on Pepa leaves with his license. maybe happines in this world exists, sometimes."

Today, the tide has turned and with the coup and purge of todays leading dynasty in Beograd, we can only spectate hell unleash in our southern neighbour. When our soldiers freed Bosnia from shackles of Ottoman Empire, some of them greeted us with ray of flowers and some with bullets, but thankfuly we managed to incorparate our 'Colony' in some form of way and capacity in to our K. K. Monarchy, with that many issues like with said Serbia arose almost unamanagable influx of terrorist Serbians trying to destroy what we have built in Bosnia and not even there but the empire as a whole, nation we supported for so long and wanted to see grow now decided to go cold and make us look like their enemy, and for that. Serbians in Bosnia and other parts of Austrian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary but especially in Bosnia, must find their own way for survival in the streets or work in a unhospitable terrains and accept that they must ne part of the cheap workforce."
  austria_hungary.6.d:0 "Our Empire was and is here for many years by now, a lot changed and will change in near future and we need to be ready for it as never before. One of those changes for sure must be done by us on our own, many land we saw as integrated under our glorious flag isn't actually as united in supporting us as we thought. Bohemian kingdom had always been very problematic for most of it's history within our empire as they were one of the nations that supported and joined in the revolution of 1848 and managed to even kill many civilians that just fled and couldn't defend themself as one of the best examples would be wife of our dearest general from those days, Windischgrätz. Galicians, the Poles mainly, had been pretty satisfied and became one of the most loyal ethnicities and people under our rule, but even with that, some of the mmore radical ones managed to be pretty aggrsive towards us. Ukrainians had always had few problems with the Poles since they both knew each other names, Vlodymyr and Pawel can never be too friendly with each other even after few beers. This sitation we stand infront of in the moment, it is our responsibility to integrate all of these groups and make sure they never plan another uprising or try to become independent from our Imperial crown, and if they try, we will do all we can to stop them."

Poles are great example of well meant fight for free and christian europe as we have seen in the days of siege of Vienna where glorious Winged Hussars with a help of others managed to break the Ottomans forces and help us regain fighting power and our will to fight, we must take examples like these and show them to people of our empire as the right example how a true christian and loyalist to the empire looks like so, at least Evidenzbureau doesn't have so much work to do."

We have been lied to, most of the parties especially on the left wing of the spectre do not wish for compromise or diplomatic actions, we simply have no other option than to keep the Reichsrat closed until the war is over...

Those are as many would like to say, the biggest enemy of the common man but in reality it is something totally different.

  austria_hungary.188.d:0 "Military, at some point the last thing we for now have to actually count with. Our Kaiser did have a meeting with the Chief of staff that went as easily as he expected but a meeting with the highest leadership of the Hungarian staff was something he was not really ready for. Most these generals were really loyal Roylalists and expected that one day this would happen, but not so early. But with Karl and his scharm, he was able to get the high command on his side, at least the highest ranks of the Honvéd, as the lowers ranks might not be as optimistic but that only time shows.
